Kitty Compass
=======
Hybrid Glassware Sample

This sample inserts a live card to the left of the Glass clock that displays a
compass. It is based upon the [gdk-compass-sample](https://github.com/googleglass/gdk-compass-sample), with the added twist of indicating nearby cat and dog themed landmarks. 

These landmarks are also used by the included Mirror API Glassware to 
power coarse location based proximity notifications.
